# Release 3

## Work routines
We have continued to use issues as basis for working on the project. Like in last iteration, we have named our branches after the issues they are connected to, the number of the issue and whether the issue is a CHANGE, DRAFT etc. As an example, the branch used to update our readme files is called 49-change-update-all-readme-files. We have added all the issues from this iteration to the milestone Release3. We start our commit messages with the tags described in [**CONTRIBUTING**](/CONTRIBUTING.md).
