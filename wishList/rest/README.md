# REST API

We've created a REST(ful) api for our service WishList which allows us in theory to set up the core logic on another
platform independently of the client.

Doing so allows the client to use our services in whatever way the want, whether it to use the application as intended
or just check for user data.

This also allows clients to set up their own platform, if they so choose, that is, using React and so on...

## How to run locally

You can run the server locally using *Maven*

First you need to install and compile:

`mvn clean install && mvn compile`

Then to run:

`mvn spring-boot:run`

*Boom* the server should now run on `http://localhost:8080/wishList/`

## Logic

The REST API is intended to be an independent server of the main application. Meaning that this could be run on a server
somewhere else. To achieve this we can communicate with the server using **HTTP** requests. Below are following
endpoints created for our REST-ful API.

When a request is received on the server, the **RESTController** converts the incoming payload and then passes the data
to the **WishListService**.

**WishListService** communicates with the applications core logic and finally returns logical data that the server then
can send back to the client, which in our case is an JavaFX application.

## Endpoints

In order to perform actions to our core logic and get data you need to access the following endpoints

```
    localhost:8080/wishList/api/v1
    
    Request Type           /ENDPOINT/
    
    GET                    /wishLists/               # Returns all wishLists
    GET                    /users/                   # Returns all users saved
    GET                    /user/{email}/            # Returns optional based on email
    GET                    /user/{email}/{password}/ # Returns optional based on email and password
    POST                   /user/add/                # Add user from json payload
    
    POST                   /user/contact/add/        # Add contact to user
    POST                   /user/contact/remove/     # Remove contact from user
    
    POST                   /user/wish/add/           # Add wish to user's wishlist
    POST                   /user/wish/remove/        # Remove wish from user's wishlist
    
    POST                   /user/wishList/add/       # Add wishList to user
    POST                   /user/wishList/remove/    # Remove wishList from user
    POST                   /user/wishList/share/     # Share wishList to group
