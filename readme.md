# Group 21 Repo - <Project name here>

## Naming conventions

We use the following naming conventions:

- FEAT - For developing new feature
- CHANGE - Updating/modifying existing code
- DRAFT - For work in progress code
- DELETE - Removal off code (no additions)

Commit messages need to follow one of these four tags before additional message i. e:
Commit messages also need to be written in present time.

`FEAT: add new component`

## Code reviews

Everytime a member of the group creates a merge request, it needs to reviewed and verified by atleast one other person before merging it.
After the MR has been verfiied and accepted, the creator of the MR needs to merge it into the master branch.

Remember to squash commits when merging, since commit messages after dosen't make much sense in the master branch.
